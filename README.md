## What is docker
* Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

* Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications

* Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

* Container's are:
  * lightweight : Absence of Kernel/OS
  * Fast: No booting mechanism
  * Portable: Due to absence of Kernel/OS, it can be easily port from one env to other. Its just like an executable [file] container.
  * Isolated - Uses **namespace**
  * Resource limit - Uses **cgroups** to limit the resource utilization.
